<h1 title="">WORKHOUSE NURSING:
<br /><span class="smallest"><i>THE STORY OF A SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT.</i></span></h1>
<p>The following pages contain a brief account of the
experiment successfully tried by the Select Vestry of
Liverpool (the guardians of the poor)&mdash;the introduction
of trained Nurses into the male wards of the
Workhouse Infirmary. That experiment having resulted
so successfully as to induce the Vestry to
extend the system to the remainder of the infirmary,
it may be interesting to those who are concerned in
the management of workhouses elsewhere to learn
something of its history and progress. It is the
writer&rsquo;s object to explain&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The grounds on which the Vestry were led to
undertake the experiment, as stated in the preliminary
report of Mr. Carr, the governor, and that of the
sub-committee of the Vestry appointed to consider
the proposed scheme; and the replies received to inquiries
addressed by them to institutions and persons
connected with the training and employment of skilled
nurses in London and Liverpool, with letters on the
subject from Miss Nightingale and Sir John M<sup>c</sup>Neill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>2. The results of the experiment, so far as hitherto
ascertained.</p>
<p>The Liverpool Vestry had previously made considerable
efforts to improve the workhouse infirmaries.
The medical men had been encouraged to make requisition
for every material appliance that could facilitate
the cure of the sick; and paid female officers were
appointed at the rate of one to each 150 or 200 beds,
to superintend the giving of medicines and stimulants,
and so forth: but of course so small a number, even
had they been trained nurses, could do no real
nursing, and could exercise little supervision over the
twenty drunken or unreliable<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> pauper nurses who
were under the nominal direction of each paid officer.
An appeal was made to the Vestry to consummate
the good work they had thus partially commenced,
and it was urged that Liverpool should assume the
lead in the task of workhouse reform. The following
considerations were submitted to the Select Vestry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That Liverpool could commence this movement
with great effect, and with the certainty that her
example would be widely followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she had in times past taken a leading part in
such reform. The introduction of the New Poor Law
produced little change in Liverpool; so many of
its wisest provisions were already in operation there,
some of them for twenty or thirty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she had already established a system of attention
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
to the sick poor in their own houses, which, if
only by restoring heads of families to health and
work, saved the parish many times the sum that it
cost to private benevolence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, lastly and especially, the proposed reform
ought to commence in Liverpool, because in her workhouse
the guardians had already, by their liberality, provided
the sick with everything in the shape of diet and
medical comforts that could conduce to recovery; and
what was now wanting to give effect to their wise
benevolence was, that their system should be administered
and their intentions carried out by efficient and
reliable nurses, in the stead of unreliable paupers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The appeal further urged that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Successful efforts have been made in many directions
to improve the nursing of the sick, and the
workhouses must soon be the object of similar endeavours.
Those poor sufferers whose disease is
protracted and hopeless are refused admission into
ordinary hospitals, and must come to the workhouse;
and the mere duration of the illness is in such cases
sufficient to reduce to poverty the most industrious,
careful, and temperate&mdash;men who, while they could
work, paid regularly their contribution to the poor-rate.
Surely, these are entitled to at least as great
care as that which sickness at once assures to the
imprisoned felon, however criminal, for whom well-paid
nurses are provided by the State.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the other class of inmates of the workhouse
infirmary&mdash;those whose ailments are curable&mdash;mere
economy requires that the most efficient means should
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
be taken to cure them as speedily as possible, so as to
preserve them and their families from becoming
paupers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus justice and expediency alike counsel the
introduction into the workhouse of the best known
system of nursing. Probably nothing which the skill
and kindness of medical men can do, no food or
physical appliances which the guardians can supply,
no oversight or care which they, acting through
pauper nurses, can bring to bear, are wanting in
the Liverpool workhouse; but it is to be feared that
much of this care, liberality, and thought fails of its
object for want of a sufficient number of reliable and
duly qualified nurses to carry out the instructions
given, to administer food and medicine to the patients,
to dress their wounds, and so forth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This appeal was supported by two letters of Miss
Nightingale and Sir John M<sup>c</sup>Neill, G.C.B., President
of the Board of Supervision (the Scotch Poor Law
Board).</p>
<hr />
<p class="center"><i>Letter from</i> <span class="sc">Miss Nightingale</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="jr1"><span class="sc">115, Park Street, W.</span>
<br /><i>February 5, 1864.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I will not delay another day expressing how much
I admire, and how deeply I sympathize with the Workhouse
plan.</p>
<p>First let me say that Workhouse sick and Workhouse
Infirmaries require quite as much care as (I had almost said
more than) Hospital sick. There is an even greater work
to be accomplished in Workhouse Infirmaries than in
Hospitals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>In days long ago, when I visited in one of the largest
London Workhouse Infirmaries, I became fully convinced
of this.</p>
<p>How gladly would I have become the Matron of a
Workhouse.</p>
<p>But of a Visitor&rsquo;s visit, the only result is to break the
Visitor&rsquo;s heart. She sees how much could be done and
cannot do it.</p>
<p>Liverpool is of all places the one to try this great Reform
in. Its example is sure to be followed. It has an admirable
body of Guardians; it is a thorough practical people; it
has, or soon will have again, money.</p>
<p>Lord Russell once said (what is quite true), that the
Poor Law was never meant to supersede private charity.</p>
<p>But whatever may be the difficulties about Pauperism,
in two things most people agree&mdash;viz. that Workhouse sick
ought to have the best practical nursing, as well as Hospital
sick&mdash;and that a good wise Matron may save many of these
from life-long pauperism, by first nursing them well, and
then rousing them to exertion, and helping them to employment.</p>
<p>In such a scheme as is wisely proposed, there would be
four elements.</p>
<p>1. The Guardians, one of whose functions is to check
pauperism. They could not be expected to incur greater
cost than at present, <i>unless</i> it is proved that it cures or
saves life.</p>
<p>2. The Visiting or Managing Committee of the Guardians,
whose authority must not (and need not) in any way be
interfered with.</p>
<p>3. The Governor, the Medical Officer, and Chaplain.</p>
<p>4. (And under the Governor) the proposed Superintendent
of Nurses and her nursing staff.</p>
<p>There is no reason why all these parts of the machine
should not work together.</p>
<p>The funds are provided to pay the extra nursing for a
time.</p>
<p>The difficulty is to find the Lady to govern it.</p>
<p>When appointed, she must be authorized&mdash;indeed
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
appointed&mdash;by the Guardians. She must be their Officer;
and must be invested by the Governor with authority to
superintend her Nurses in conformity with regulations to
be agreed upon.</p>
<p>So far, I see no more difficulty than there was in settling
our relations as Nurses to the government officials in the
Crimean War.</p>
<p>The cases are somewhat similar.</p>
<p>As to the funds, it is just possible that eventually the
Guardians might take all the cost on themselves, as soon
as they saw the great advantages and economy of good
nursing.</p>
<p>If Liverpool succeeds, the system is quite sure to extend
itself.</p>
<p>The Fever Hospital is one of the Workhouse Infirmaries.
That is the place to shew what skilful nursing can do.
The patients are not all paupers. How many families might
be rescued from pauperism by saving the lives of their
heads, and by helping the hard-working to more speedy
convalescence!</p>
<p class="jr1">Hopefully yours,
<br />(Signed)<span class="hst"> FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.</span></p>

<hr />
<p class="center"><i>Extract from a letter from the</i> <span class="sc">Right Honourable Sir John M<sup>c</sup>Neill</span>, G.C.B., <i>dated Granton House, Edinburgh, 28th Feb., 1864</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There can be no doubt, I think, that it would be a
mistake to have pauper nurses mixed up with paid nurses,
and I think I expressed that opinion when we conversed
about those things. Paupers might, however, be employed
to scrub and to do other menial work, under the orders of
the paid nurses. If the paid nurses are to do much good
they must have a recognised authority in their wards.
Without authority there cannot be due responsibility, and
things must get into confusion. A nurse carrying out the
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
instructions of the medical officer must have authority to
do so, and resistance to that authority must be treated as
a breach of discipline.</p>
<p>To put this upon a right footing from the first, would
be indispensable to success. The more a nurse does by
influence, and kindly influence, the better; but dealing with
the promiscuous inmates of a workhouse, the knowledge
that there is authority in reserve to be exercised if necessary,
prevents the necessity of resorting to it, and makes the
patients duly appreciate the kindness which keeps it in
reserve.</p>
<p>With regard to all such matters, a great deal will depend
upon the good-will, the good sense, and good feeling of the
Governor and Matron, but especially of the Governor. He
can do much to promote or to mar the success of the experiment,
and so can the medical men; but if they be men
of sense and right feeling, they cannot fail to perceive how
vast an addition to their own comfort the permanent establishment
of such a system as you propose to introduce
experimentally, must produce.</p>
<p>The position of a medical man dependent for the execution
of his instructions upon nurses who are neither intelligent
nor trustworthy, is very painful, and tends to deteriorate
his own character, both as a man and as a practitioner, by
rendering him callous to preventible suffering which he is
denied the proper means of relieving, and by compelling
him to forego the use of remedies which require intelligence
and conscientious care in administering them. The house
Governor, if he be a conscientious man, must be kept in
continual anxiety about the conduct of ignorant, and often
worthless pauper nurses in the hospital, and is driven at
length to be satisfied with a low moral and intellectual
standard in the nurses, and a corresponding standard of
care and comfort in the hospital.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Select Vestry took the subject into their serious
consideration, and instituted most careful inquiries in
various quarters. Among other steps, they called for
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
a report on the probable operation of the proposed
system from Mr. Carr, the Governor of the Workhouse.
That report ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="tbcenter"><i>Extract from the Journal of the Governor of the Workhouse.</i></p>
<p class="jr1"><span class="sc">Liverpool, Thursday</span>, <i>April 14, 1864</i>.</p>
<p>In compliance with the instructions of the Workhouse
Committee, I have carefully considered the proposal made to
the Committee by a Liverpool gentleman, on the subject of
nursing the sick in the Workhouse Hospital, and beg in
reference thereto to report&mdash;</p>
<p>That, practically, the proposal amounts to this&mdash;that there
shall not be any pauper nurses in the hospital, but that there
shall be appointed in lieu a staff of duly qualified paid nurses
and servants, with a head superintendent, under whom the
whole of the nursing of the sick shall be conducted on the
best known principles.</p>
<p>This proposal rests its claim to favourable consideration on
the presumption that the present system of nursing the sick
in the Workhouse Hospital is defective. The Committee are
aware what that system is. It may thus be briefly stated.
Certain wards of the workhouse are set apart as hospital
wards. They do not form an hospital worked as a whole, but
are divided into five portions, each forming a distinct set of
wards, in close proximity to the wards of the healthy paupers,
and in five different parts of the workhouse. These five sets
of wards I shall call the Workhouse Hospital. The hospital
is divided into eleven sections. At the head of each section
there is an intelligent paid superintendent nurse, and under
each such superintendent nurse there is placed a staff of
pauper nurses, with the aid of whom she is required to work
her division, according to certain rules and regulations made
and provided for that purpose. A copy of these rules is
appended hereto; from which it will be seen that the burden
of the responsibility of carrying out the orders of the medical
officers, devolves upon the head nurses or superintendents of
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
divisions. The pauper nurses clean up the wards, carry the
food, and give general assistance to the superintendent&mdash;the
duties of nursing in detail, that is to say, the bedside nursing,
falling chiefly upon them. They are not permitted, however,
to serve any patient with stimulants, beer, porter, or medicines
requiring exactness or care; all such duties are discharged
by the superintendent nurse. The proposal now made
to the Committee, means that the paid staff shall be increased,
so that the sick shall be cared for by responsible officers only,
and not left, even partially, to the care of pauper nurses.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that pauper nurses are unreliable, inefficient,
and many of them very worthless; and it is only by
careful watching, and the utmost stringency of regulations,
that they can be made serviceable in the hospital. No stringency
of regulations, however, could guard against the most
flagrant abuses, if these women were employed to discharge
duties of trust, such as serving out the stimulants, &amp;c. so that
their services in attending upon the sick are limited and common-place.
There is therefore, in my mind, no doubt, and I
cannot see how any doubt can exist, that to remove these
women, and appoint in their places women of character,
trained as nurses, will tend to improve the position of the
sick, and more rapidly restore many of them to health.</p>
<p>To displace these pauper women, however, involves a complete
change in all the hospital arrangements, and suggests
the difficulty of finding and keeping up a supply of suitable
nurses to undertake the work at, as it would no doubt often
happen, short notice. The Committee are aware, too, that
owing to the fact that the paupers have hitherto been required
to attend upon the sick, the accommodation for paid officers
is very limited, and that the adoption of the proposal would
render it necessary at once to provide additional rooms for
the additional staff. The Committee are also aware that the
Workhouse Hospital differs from other hospitals in this&mdash;that
it forms a part only of a mixed establishment, and that there
are great difficulties to be overcome in completely cutting off
every connexion or species of intercourse between the hospital
departments and the healthy inmates, without which the
scheme under consideration could hardly succeed. If any
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
good is to result from the adoption of this proposal, the sick
should be placed absolutely and entirely in the hands of a
paid staff, without the assistance, in any form, of any one of
the pauper inmates. Cut off the hospital department from
the healthy wards; and do not, under any pretext, suffer
communication between the sick and the healthy, and you
strike at the root of every species of workhouse abuse; but if,
under any pretext, you suffer a large number of healthy
paupers to pass daily into the sick departments, as they now
do, the adoption of the proposal will effect little good.</p>
<p>But the question has to be still further investigated on the
ground of expense; and it has to be decided the number,
pay, allowances, and accommodation of the necessary staff to
work it out. Now, although I entertain very strong opinions
as to the undesirability of employing paupers to discharge
responsible duties of any kind, because to do so destroys the
value of the workhouse test, and tends to reconcile them to
pauperism; and although I view the particular work of nurse-tending
as the very worst kind of work for paupers, inasmuch
as, while so employed, they are better fed, have more
freedom of action than they otherwise would, and can make
their places emolumental&mdash;thereby holding out a positive
inducement to pauperism; and although I have no doubt that
the displacement of these women would be followed by the
immediate application for discharges by a large per-centage
of them; and although, at this moment, many other weighty
considerations press upon me in favour of the immediate
adoption of the proposal under consideration, I feel unwilling,
in view of the difficulties to be overcome, some of which I
have indicated, to incur the weighty responsibility of recommending
such a course on my own unaided judgment. I
have abstained, therefore, from taking up the question of
expense, &amp;c. but take the liberty respectfully to suggest, that
a sub-committee be appointed to report upon the whole question
in all its details. It shall be my anxious desire and
pleasure to assist the labours of such sub-committee by every
means in my power.</p>

<p>According to the recommendation of Mr. Carr, a
Sub-Committee was appointed, consisting of men of
great experience in parochial business, who went up
to London, and had interviews with the medical and
other officers of the two metropolitan hospitals where
nursing has been brought to the greatest perfection&mdash;St.
Thomas&rsquo;s and King&rsquo;s College Hospitals. Finding
that some of these gentlemen wished for more information
respecting the Workhouse Hospital system
before they would venture to express decided opinions
as to the economical results of the proposed reform,
the Liverpool Visitors drew up a statement on several
points affecting this question, with written inquiries,
to which answers were returned, verbally or in writing,
by the gentlemen consulted. This statement, with the
replies which it elicited, is here given at length:&mdash;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="tbcenter"><span class="small">STATEMENT AND QUESTIONS OF THE LIVERPOOL SUB-COMMITTEE.</span></p>
<p>The population of the Parish of Liverpool is about 270,000.</p>
<p>The expenditure from the poor&rsquo;s-rate in and about the
relief of the poor is about 100,000<i>l</i>. per annum.</p>
<p>Of this about 40,000<i>l</i>. is distributed in out-door relief as
money and bread. (Of course sickness is one great cause of
persons seeking relief, though to what extent this cause
operates, even directly, I cannot on so short a notice ascertain
or even estimate.)</p>

</table>
<p>The weekly discharges are from twenty to thirty per cent.
of the whole number in the hospital.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The present workhouse staff consists of fourteen paid
officers (who are superintendents, but not trained nurses), and
about 150 paupers acting as nurses, but not paid. It has
been proposed to add a trained hospital matron and trained
nurses, such as those trained in the Nightingale School, and
assistant nurses, so as to give one trained day-nurse and one
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
paid assistant to about every three pauper nurses, and a
trained night-nurse on every flat; it is further proposed to
pay the paupers who act as nurses, wages. The cost of this
would be about 2,000<i>l</i>. per annum.</p>
<p>Does your experience of hospitals lead you to believe that
the cost of this improved system would be &ldquo;in part,&rdquo; &ldquo;wholly,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;more than&rdquo; repaid to the ratepayers by curing people
more quickly, by curing those who otherwise might have
become chronic cases, and by enabling those to resume their
work who must otherwise have remained or died, and by thus
diminishing the duration or amount of that part of pauperism
which is the result of sickness?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>The inclosed paper was sent to me yesterday, with
the request that I would obtain from some of the medical
staff of this Hospital answers to the question proposed at the
end of the paper, in order to enable the Vestry in some degree
to judge whether that body would be justified, or otherwise, in
sanctioning the introduction to their Workhouse Hospital of
an improved system of nursing the sick, at the probable
annual money cost named in the inclosed paper.</p>
<p>I have accordingly submitted the paper to as many of
the medical staff as I could see in the short time.</p>
<p>I inclose a note from Mr. Henry Smith, one of the
surgeons, who has had considerable experience as to the loss
and gain of good and bad nursing.</p>
<p>Dr. Wm. O. Priestly, the Physician Accoucheur to this
Hospital, formerly of Middlesex Hospital, had not time during
his visit to do more than read the paper and give me a verbal
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
answer. He said, &ldquo;I have no hesitation in saying that the
saving would be certain and great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Assistant Physician Accoucheur, who has until last
week had charge of the medical patients here, as House
Physician (Mr. H. L. Kempthorne), says, &ldquo;The value of trained
efficient nursing cannot be overrated in the management of
acute diseases, and especially fevers, and would speak for
itself in the saving of life, humanly speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In chronic cases, the eye of the trained nurse would soon
detect the malingerer, and thus save the parish the expense of
maintaining one who could well keep himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the prevention and amelioration of disease this plan
would soon show its importance in the effects of cleanliness,
ventilation, and other points carried out systematically and
intelligently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moral influence of the trained nurses by precept and
example must in time diffuse itself through the medium of
the pauper nurses to the paupers in hospital, the workhouse,
and thence to the parish at large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I regret my inability to obtain fuller testimony to-day,
but professional men are busy, and their visits to the hospital
only on stated days.</p>
<p>If I can be of further use in any way, pray command me.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>After collecting and considering all the information
within their reach, the Sub-Committee reported as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Sub-Committee appointed on the 14th ultimo to
consider and report as to a suggested alteration in the
Staff of the Workhouse Hospital, report,</p>
<p>That the superiority, as nurses, of trained, experienced, and
responsible women to the pauper women upon whom, under
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
the present system, the actual nursing of the sick inmates
of the workhouse devolves, is so apparent, that they conceive
it to be unnecessary to offer any further observations upon
this part of the subject. The points which have mainly
occupied your Committee&rsquo;s attention are the following:&mdash;</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. The cost of introducing a staff of trained nurses into the Workhouse Hospital, or any portion thereof.</dt>
<dt>2. The practicability of providing sufficient accommodation in the Workhouse for such an increase of officers.</dt>
<dt>3. The supply of trained nurses.</dt></dl>
<p>1. Your Committee are of opinion that the substitution
throughout the Workhouse Hospital of trained nurses, for
the present pauper nurses, would involve a direct expenditure
of from 2,000<i>l.</i> to 2,500<i>l.</i> per annum. Should it be
decided, in the first instance, to introduce the nurses into
the male hospital only, it is probable that a sum of 800<i>l.</i>
per annum would be found sufficient for the purpose. Evidence
has been laid before the Committee to show that in
those hospitals where the improved system of nursing has
been introduced, the increased cost thereof has been more
than compensated for by the saving, from the reduction of the
time during which the patients are under treatment&mdash;the effect,
as is alleged, of good and efficient nursing. Whilst your Committee
admit the force of the argument, that if this be so
in the case of hospitals, where the sick only are burdens
upon the funds of the institution, much more must it be so
in the case of the parish, where, as often happens, the whole
family are chargeable upon the rates in consequence of the
sickness of its head; they think it necessary to point out
that one great difference between the workhouse hospital and
an ordinary infirmary consists in this, that while in the latter
(as a rule) none but acute and supposed curable cases are
admitted, the former is, in many cases, the refuge of those
who, as incurables, cannot gain admittance to other asylums.
There can, however, be no doubt that the saving resulting
from the rapidity and completeness of the cures effected by
good nursing, will be a considerable set-off against the increased
cost of the nursing staff; though your Committee
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
can offer no decided opinion as to the probable extent of the
saving so effected.</p>
<p>2. Your Committee believe that accommodation equal at
least, if not superior, to that afforded to the nurses in the
London hospitals, can be provided in the Workhouse at a
moderate outlay. It is estimated that, for the male hospital,
a sum of from 400<i>l.</i> to 500<i>l.</i> would suffice to provide the
rooms and to furnish them.</p>
<p>3. With reference to the supply of suitable nurses, your
Committee have to report that, as the authorities of the
Nightingale Training School for nurses have offered to render
to the Select Vestry all the assistance in their power in
obtaining trained nurses, no great difficulty on this point need
be apprehended.</p>
<p>Were your Committee as sanguine as some of the hospital
authorities whom they have consulted, as to the happy results
to be expected from the introduction of trained nurses into
the Workhouse, they would at once, with the utmost confidence,
recommend that the whole of the hospital should, at
the cost of the parish, be supplied with this class of officers;
but, looking upon it as they do, as an experiment (at least in
its economical results), they unanimously recommend that
the system should, in the first instance, be tried in the male
hospital.</p>
<p class="jr1">J. W. CROPPER, <i>Chairman</i>.</p>
<p><i>May 5, 1864.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report of the Sub-Committee met with the
approval of the Vestry. Some delay in the adoption
of its recommendations was caused by a severe outbreak
of fever in the town, which for the time
absorbed all the resources of the Vestry and its
officers. But on the 18th of May, 1865, a Lady
Superintendent who had received a thorough training
at Kaiserswerth and St. Thomas&rsquo;s, twelve Nightingale
nurses from St. Thomas&rsquo;s, eighteen probationers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
and fifty-two of the old pauper nurses were placed
in charge of the patients in the male wards of the
Workhouse Infirmary. By the judicious management
of Mr. Carr, the most admirable arrangements were
made for the accommodation of the nurses. Each
superior nurse had a little room to herself, and the
ex-pauper nurses were entirely separated from the
other inmates of the Workhouse. It was hoped that
by taking the best of the able-bodied inmates, separating
them from the other paupers, and paying
them small wages (say 5<i>l.</i> a year) they might be
made available as assistant nurses, and that many
of them might be elevated into independence and
usefulness. It will be seen from the foregoing report
of the Governor (p. 10), that he always distrusted
this part of the plan adopted; and after the system
had been at work a year, this attempt to utilize
pauper nurses in a workhouse hospital was found
to have utterly failed. It was proved that in a
town like Liverpool, with very few exceptions, those
able-bodied women only become inmates of the Workhouse
who are either tainted in character, or are
exceptionally ill-educated and inefficient. The experiment,
however, was not wholly useless. It conclusively
established two facts: that such women
are utterly unfit to be trusted as nurses; and that
their employment in that capacity does not effect
all the saving that might be supposed. It might
be thought that the choice lay between such employment
and maintaining the pauper in idleness, while
paying a nurse in her stead. But it was found&mdash;as
the Governor had always predicted&mdash;that when sent
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
back from the hospital to the able-bodied wards,
nearly the whole of these women left the Workhouse,
and relieved the parish from the charge of their
maintenance. Many of these women, when employed
as nurses, remain in the Workhouse for the sake of
what they can pick up or extort. And moreover,
when they left it, the training they had received,
such as it was, rendered them more intelligent, and
perhaps not more unreliable nurses than those usually
employed by the poor. It is not unlikely that in
country places the unfitness of able-bodied paupers
to become assistant nurses may be far less than it
has been found to be in a great seaport town like
Liverpool. They may probably be less universally
tainted in character, and after a year or two of
employment as under-nurses they may be able to
maintain themselves in that capacity out-of-doors,
thus not only relieving the parish of their own
maintenance, but assisting to diminish sickness and
pauperism among their neighbours. The point is
one which must be left to local knowledge and experience.
It might be well, however, not to promise
them payment till after some length of probationary
service. It was always after pay-day that the ex-pauper
nurses were most liable to get drunk and
misbehave.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> With the exception of the failure of
the nurses taken from the pauper class, the first
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
year&rsquo;s trial was sufficiently successful to induce a
continuance of the experiment. It was impossible,
however, to judge the result by statistics. None
that were available could be considered as an evidence
of success or failure, for several reasons. The
season was very unhealthy, and to relieve the pressure
on the space and resources of the hospital, steps were
taken to treat slight cases outside, as will be seen
from the following extract from the Minutes of the
Finance Committee, 24th November, 1865:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The district medical officers, Dr. Gee, Mr. Barnes, and
the Governor of the workhouse being in attendance, pursuant
to resolution of the Workhouse Committee at its meeting
yesterday, the practicability of limiting the admissions to
the Workhouse Hospital was considered, and the district
medical officers were requested to co-operate with the relieving
officers in limiting such admissions to those cases that cannot
be properly treated outside the Workhouse.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The endeavour to limit the admissions to serious
cases would of course affect the returns, both as
regards the time taken in curing, and the proportion
of deaths. Even had there been no exceptional disturbing
element, there is a defect in the statistics of
workhouse hospitals which affects all inferences from
them, in the absence of any careful classified list of
cases kept by the medical officers, such as might
fairly enable one to form a judgment from mere
statistical tables. These, then, are not reliable as
means of judgment, unless extending over a long
period. The character of seasons, and nature of cases
admitted, varies so much from year to year as to
invalidate any deductions, unless founded on
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
complete and minutely kept medical records. The following
extracts, however, from the reports of the
Governor, and the surgical and medical officers of the
Workhouse, bear decisive witness to the value of the
&ldquo;new system,&rdquo; especially as contrasted with the
&ldquo;old system,&rdquo; which in 1865-66 still prevailed in
the female wards. All these reports bear emphatic
testimony to the merits and devotion of the Lady
Superintendent and her staff. The medical men, it
is noteworthy, speak strongly of the better discipline
and far greater obedience to their orders observable
where the trained nurses are employed&mdash;a point the
more important because it is that on which, before
experience has reassured them, medical and other
authorities have often been most doubtful.</p>
<hr />
<p class="center"><i>From the Report of the Governor.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="jr1"><span class="sc">Thursday</span>, <i>May 10, 1866</i>.</p>
<p>The main feature in the new system of nursing consists
in the superseding of pauper nurses, and appointing in their
places competent trained nurses from the Nightingale School.
These latter to have the assistance of &ldquo;probationary nurses,&rdquo;
or in other words, women of intelligence and of good character
desirous of entering upon the duties of nursing the sick as
a profession. A third class was also created, designated
&ldquo;Assistants.&rdquo; These were selected from the old pauper nurses,
and it was decided that they should be paid, clothed, and
receive rations equal in quality and quantity to those issued
to the officers of the workhouse. The nurses, probationers,
and assistants were placed under the control of a &ldquo;Lady Superintendent,&rdquo;
who was empowered to employ them in the
manner to her seeming best for the proper care of the sick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The Committee will be prepared to hear that the change
was immediately followed by the most marked improvement
in every respect. The most casual observer could not avoid
perceiving it. This applies not only to the state of the
wards, the care of the sick, but is particularly observable in
the demeanour of the patients, upon whom the humanizing
influences of a body of women of character, devotedly discharging
their duties, has produced evident fruits.</p>
<p>The question has often been asked whether the &ldquo;new
system is likely to succeed?&rdquo; The &ldquo;old system&rdquo; meant
nothing more than this, that old, ignorant, and unreliable
pauper women, many of whom were of doubtful character,
were entrusted with the discharge, without pay, of responsible
duties. These have been displaced, and active, intelligent,
reliable women, trained and skilled as nurses, with good
characters and pay, have been appointed to supersede them.
It would be a great discredit if these latter did not discharge
their duties incomparably better than the former could do.
That they do so I am happy to be in a position to testify.</p>
<p>In the opening paragraph of this report it is stated that
&ldquo;assistant nurses&rdquo; were appointed and placed upon pay from
the ranks of the paupers. This I was always opposed to.
Their employment has resulted in complete failure, as the
following figures will prove. The total number appointed to
this date is 141. Of these sixty-seven have been dismissed
through drunkenness and other misconduct, and sixteen have
resigned; while it is positively true that there is not one of
the whole number to whom I could entrust the duties of
serving out wine or other stimulants, or, in fact, any duty
requiring the exercise of integrity.</p>
<p>The experience of the past year renders it certain that the
Poor Law, as now existing, offers no impediments to the
successful working out of the most complete scheme for the
efficient nursing of the sick, in the manner advocated by the
best friends of hospital nursing.</p>

nurses must not be construed as an unfavourable reflection on
the <i>whole</i> of the previous staff. The paid superintending
nurses of departments, and a few of the unpaid pauper nurses,
deserve great credit for their conduct, though their qualifications
for the service were decidedly inferior to those of the
trained &ldquo;Nightingale&rdquo; staff.</p>
<p>With regard to the latter I can cordially bear testimony
to their ability, and to their unwearied and uniformly kind
attention to the patients under their charge. As to their
nursing in its specific sense, I may state my belief that in
every case my directions and those of the House Surgeons
have been rigidly carried out. The medicines, stimulants,
&amp;c. &amp;c. have been carefully administered, and the other
numerous but less agreeable duties have been faithfully and
efficiently attended to. Under their charge I have perceived
a marked improvement in the demeanour of the patients&mdash;in
fact, the discipline of the wards is completely changed. There
has been no disorder or irregularity, but a sense of comfort,
order, and quiet pervades the whole department. I believe
further, that every patient leaving the wards has been more
or less morally elevated during his location there.</p>

<p class="tbcenter"><i>From the Report of</i> <span class="sc">J. H. Barnes, Esq.</span>, <i>Surgeon</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="jr1"><i>March 21, 1866.</i></p>
<p>Since my connexion with the hospital last August we
have had somewhat approaching a hundred operations, many
of them of a serious and dangerous character, requiring not
only prompt assistance at the time, but most persevering
attention night and day for a long time after. Almost all
these operations have been in the male hospital, and I have
no hesitation in saying that what success has attended them
has been greatly owing to the most efficient assistance
rendered by the trained nurses; and from my experience of
the assistance received from the pauper nurses, in the few
cases of operation performed in the female hospital, I should
feel great diffidence in undertaking on that side such operations
as I have had on the other side: indeed on one or two
occasions the pauper nurses ran away, and when induced to
assist were so nervous and frightened as to be of little
service.</p>
<p>Without any wish to speak harshly of the unpaid nurses
employed on the female side of the hospital (who, I believe,
strive to do their best, more especially since a feeling of
emulation has been set up by the introduction of the paid
trained nurses, of whom they are jealous), I am compelled
to state my conviction that on that side my directions are
not carried out with that necessary promptitude and skill
that they are on the other side, and that in all I do there I
feel as if I were working with blunted instruments. There
is no want of inclination, but simply a want of ability. That
<i>integrity of disposition, promptitude of action, tact in manipulation,
gentleness of demeanour and kindly consideration</i>
necessary to make a nurse are not found, or <i>to be</i> found
in the inmates of a workhouse, and no amount of education
can work out of them what never was in them. Almost
always obtuse, and too often unprincipled, as a class they are
thoroughly unreliable, and quite unfitted to take charge of
the sick and helpless, or the stimulants necessary for them.
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
On this last point I have been informed by a former resident
surgeon that he has known the pauper nurses appropriate the
patient&rsquo;s stimulants, or withhold giving to a dying patient that
ordered for him, that they might take it themselves after his
death. It is difficult to bring home and prove these things,
and I do not wish to say they now occur, but if we wish to
put such conduct out of the region of possibility it can only
be done by the employment of persons superior to the temptation
so to act.</p>
<p>Persons of one class, as a rule, favour their own class, and
there is a far better chance of double-dealers being detected
when under the observation and care of a trained nurse, than
when under the care of one of themselves. That such is the
case my own experience testifies.</p>
<p>As far, therefore, as my experience extends of the system
of trained nurses, whether regarding the saving of life, the
restoration to health, or the relief of the suffering, it has been
an undoubted success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These reports were duly considered by the
authorities; and after some discussion, it was resolved
entirely to discontinue, in the male hospital
ward, the employment of paupers as assistant nurses,
and to substitute an additional number of probationers.
A Sub-Committee of the Workhouse Committee was
appointed to superintend and report upon the working
of the system. These gentlemen devoted much time
and attention to the subject, and at the close of the
year undertook a minute inquiry into the operation
of the old and new systems; examining personally
the various officers of the Workhouse, from the
Governor down to the pauper nurses in the female
wards. Increased experience brought out in a yet
stronger light the superior advantages of the employment
of trained nurses. The very able, clear, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
conclusive report of the Sub-Committee leaves little
more to be said on the subject. It determined the
Vestry to adopt the system in permanence, and to
extend it to the whole of the Workhouse Infirmary,
a year before the period fixed for the trial of the
experiment had expired. It will be seen that the
report of the second year&rsquo;s experience has a peculiar
value, as bearing on the question whether, or how
far, women may be competent to undertake one of
the most delicate and difficult kinds of feminine
work&mdash;one requiring special knowledge as well as
special habits of punctual regularity, obedience, and
thoughtfulness&mdash;without receiving any special training
or education for such a duty. If the reforms
about to be introduced into the pauper hospitals in
London and elsewhere are not to end in failure and
disappointment, provision must be made for training
the nurses to be employed there, either before they
enter the hospitals or within them.</p>
<p>The report of the Sub-Committee of Superintendence
is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Special Committee on Nursing, pursuant to resolution
of the Workhouse Committee of the 7th of March instant,
report,</p>
<p>That the Men&rsquo;s Hospital (exclusive of fever patients) is at
present exclusively nursed by skilled, <i>i. e.</i> specially trained
nurses and paid assistants, who are themselves undergoing
training as nurses; the staff consisting of the Superintendent,
nine of the nurses originally sent from the Nightingale School,
five nurses who have been trained in the Workhouse, and
fifteen probationary or assistant nurses.</p>
<p>Of the character of the nursing in this portion of the Workhouse,
your Committee have heard but one opinion. The
Governor and the Medical Officers concur in speaking of it in
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
terms of the highest praise, and throughout the whole period
during which the Committee have superintended it, no single
circumstance has come to their knowledge calculated to make
them speak of it otherwise than in terms of approval.</p>
<p>The nursing of the women&rsquo;s wards continues to be done by
paupers under the superintendence of paid officers. The
superintendence of these officers is of necessity very imperfect,
as not only has each charge of from 150 to 200 patients,
but these patients are located in several rooms, each ward
containing about twenty patients. The only portion of the
nursing, properly so called, which these officers undertake, is
the administration of stimulants and in some exceptional
cases of medicine. The bulk of it, as the giving of medicine,
the dressing of wounds, the distribution of food, is left to be
done by paupers. So much has from time to time been said
of the untrustworthiness of pauper nurses, of the evils
resulting to those patients who are placed exclusively under
them, of the mischievous consequences upon the discipline of
the Workhouse of a large number of petty offices being filled
by able-bodied women, that your Committee believe they
rightly interpret the feeling of the Select Vestry, as they
undoubtedly do that of the general public, in supposing that
the actual nursing of the sick in the Liverpool Workhouse
can no longer be left in the hands of pauper nurses.</p>
<p>Starting from this point, your Committee considered that
they had principally to inquire what sort of nursing can be
most advantageously substituted for that of nursing by
paupers. Two courses only appeared to be open to them&mdash;either
to increase the number of paid officers, giving to each
such a number of patients as she could reasonably be expected
to look after, and treating each as an independent officer; or
to extend over the whole hospital the system now in existence
in the men&rsquo;s wards. Your Committee were much aided in
forming a judgment upon this point, by what has taken place
during the last few months in the fever hospital.</p>
<p>Here, originally, the paid attendants were in precisely the
same position, with precisely similar duties as the paid
officers in the women&rsquo;s hospital; but the number of patients
rapidly diminishing, and no corresponding reduction taking
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
place in the number of officers, the staff was so large that Dr.
Gee felt able to call upon the officers to act as nurses. The
result was what might have been anticipated, that although
an improvement upon the old system of nursing by paupers
was perceptible, the state of the nursing was still far short of
the standard reached in the men&rsquo;s wards.</p>
<p>The officers were told to nurse, and they did their best,
but never having themselves been taught, their attempts
in a great measure failed; they were paid and retained as
nurses, without being efficient nurses.</p>
<p>Your Committee therefore recommend that as soon as
the requisite number of trained nurses can be procured, the
nursing in the women&rsquo;s hospital, and afterwards in the fever
hospital, be placed in the hands of trained and skilled nurses,
acting under the direction and control of Miss Jones, the
present Superintendent. The expenses (beyond the item of
wages) attendant upon the necessary increase in the number
of nurses will not be great, as all that will be necessary
will be to convert two of the rooms now used for sick boys
into sleeping apartments for the nurses. In making this
recommendation, the Committee are glad to know that they
are fortified by the unanimous opinion of the Governor and
the Medical Officers of the Workhouse.</p>
<p>Your Committee are bound to add that they can produce
no statistics shewing that the nursing in the men&rsquo;s hospital
has been of any economical advantage to the Parish; but as
it needs no argument to prove that the cheapest course
that can be taken with a sick pauper is to cure him as
quickly as possible; as it is evident that the care and
attention of a skilled nurse must tend to a more speedy
recovery; as the order and discipline of a well-regulated
ward is more distasteful to many of the more worthless
inmates, than the laxer management of a room in the hands
of a pauper nurse; and as the abolition of a large number
of petty offices for able-bodied paupers must lead to many of
them leaving the Workhouse, there are strong grounds for
hoping that the economical results of the change cannot
but be beneficial.</p>
<p>With regard to the future, your Committee recommend
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
that the Department of Nursing should be placed under
the direction of a small committee of your body, and that
all changes in the staff should be made only by them. From
information they have received, your Committee have reason
to believe that if, after the Workhouse is supplied with Nurses,
the two classes of nurses, <i>i.e.</i> trained nurses and probationers,
be maintained, the cost of the Department may be considerably
lessened by training nurses for other hospitals; the cost
of the probationers being either paid for by a Government
grant, or by the bodies for whom the nurses may be trained.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This report was unanimously adopted by the
Workhouse Committee and by the Vestry; and already
the new system has been extended to the
Female Wards. It is in contemplation to extend it
also to the Fever Hospital, as soon as a sufficient
number of suitable nurses shall have been trained.</p>
<p>It will be observed that the report contemplates
the training of probationers for other Workhouse
Infirmaries. And it is, indeed, to be hoped that in
this and other ways the Liverpool Workhouse Hospital
may serve as a normal school, from which the system
there adopted may spread. The <i>special</i> expenses of
such a school would naturally be borne by the parishes
which profited by its services in educating nurses
for them, or by the Government. But this point is
one which, as yet, has hardly demanded practical
consideration.</p>
<p>The experiment whose results have been recorded,
could hardly have been tried at all&mdash;certainly could
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
not have achieved such rapid success&mdash;had it not
been for the powerful and liberal assistance of Miss
Nightingale, and the Trustees of the Nightingale
Fund. Feeling how very important was the extension
of the system of superior professional nursing, now
gradually gaining ground in general hospitals, to
workhouses, they sent, to assist in the initial experiment
made in this direction, a lady superintendent
and twelve superior nurses&mdash;a very expensive
and quite invaluable contribution. To the Liverpool
Vestry and its officers belongs the credit of having
overcome all the difficulties, and persevered in spite
of all the discouraging incidents, which necessarily
attended an attempt to introduce a new system of
management into such an institution as a Workhouse
Hospital, combining as it does two subjects so different
in their aspects and conditions of treatment, so difficult
to deal with together, as pauperism and sickness.
Of the Lady Superintendent I shall say little. When
a lady leaves a happy home, and goes through a long
and laborious course of training to fit herself for such
a situation, purely because, feeling that she possessed
the capacity for nursing, and the requisite health,
energy, strength, and spirits, she desired to devote
such powers to the service of those who stood most
in need of them, human praise or criticism of her
choice is out of place. One of the incidental results
of her exertions has to her, no doubt, been even a
higher reward than that improvement in the condition
of the sick, in their progress towards recovery, and
their material comfort, which has been the direct
object of her labours. The improvement in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
tone and behaviour of the patients has been wonderful.
Many of the inmates of a pauper hospital are
persons of the worst character, and its wards, under
the control of pauper nurses, often present scenes so
disgusting that the respectable poor shrink from them
with utter abhorrence, and after once becoming acquainted
with them, will often rather die than return
thither. When the trained nurses were first introduced,
the most offensive language was frequently
heard in the wards; and the Lady Superintendent
has repeatedly been obliged to call upon the Governor
two or three times during one Sunday to use his
authority to put a stop to actual fighting. Now,
though his support is always promptly rendered, she
is rarely compelled to apply for it; the feeling of the
wards promptly suppresses all offensive language or
unseemly behaviour in the presence of the nurses.
The following letter from Sir H. Verney, Chairman of
the Nightingale Committee, serves to illustrate the
influence of the nurses upon the conduct of the
patients; he came down to Liverpool to inspect the
Hospital, and ascertain the progress of the work:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="jr1"><span class="sc">Liverpool</span>, <i>October 3, 1866</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>By the kindness of Mr. Carr I have paid a visit
to the Workhouse, and have been greatly interested by
remarking the change among the male pauper sick, effected
since I was here about two years since. I conclude that
this is owing to the nursing by a class of females so entirely
different to those who nursed the male paupers at
that time, and who still nurse the female sick. I have
always seen that the influence of respectable and well-educated
females over the most debased men is very
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
striking. Men of that character, accustomed to intercourse
with only degraded women, feel the restraining and humanizing
power of virtuous and well-mannered females. They
have never been admitted into intercourse with such before,
and they are most beneficially affected by it. I have been
told that the police officers, who sometimes come to the
Workhouse on business, and who see the sick paupers, are
much astonished. They see the men whom they have
known as the very worst characters, conducting themselves
with propriety and decency, and giving no cause of complaint.</p>
<p>I am sure that the Workhouse Committee must rejoice
and feel thankful that there is such a change in the
condition of the poor creatures brought under their rule.</p>
<p>Miss Jones, and her nurses and probationers, must have
had much difficulty at first&mdash;indeed their work is still very
trying; but the improved demeanour of the men must be
highly gratifying and encouraging to them. I walked through
the female sick wards; they were clean and sweet, but I
could not help contrasting the pauper nurses who attended
them, with the intelligent-looking respectable attendants of
the men.</p>
<p>I thank you for the note of introduction which procured
admission for me, and</p>
<p class="center">I am,
<br />Yours very faithfully,
<span class="lr">HARRY VERNEY.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such, and so entirely satisfactory to the Guardians,
were the results of the experiment of nursing by
trained nurses, as tried for two years in the Male
Wards of the Liverpool Workhouse Infirmary. It
is in order to render those results, the experience
acquired in this initiatory attempt, available for the
assistance and encouragement of others, that they
have been thus briefly recorded. Much more might
have been said; but what is here set down is sufficient
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
to explain all that practical men would wish to know,
and it would be presumption to waste the time
of such men with comments and inferences which
they are perfectly able to make for themselves.</p>
<p>One suggestion, in conclusion, I may be permitted
to offer. In all unions or parishes where additional
accommodation may be required, whether for patients
or for healthy paupers, it is eminently desirable that
in providing it regard should be had to the entire
separation, at once or at a future time, of the sick
and infirm from the able-bodied, as will be the case,
at least partially, under the new r&eacute;gime introduced
in the Metropolis by Mr. Gathorne Hardy&rsquo;s Bill.
Miss Nightingale has from the first held and expressed
a strong opinion in favour of the separation
of the hospital and workhouse administrations. The
Governor of the Liverpool Workhouse, Mr. Carr, expressed
himself decidedly in the same sense; and the
Chairman of the Workhouse Committee and of the
Sub-Committee appointed to superintend the Hospital,
has been induced by practical experience warmly to
advocate the absolute separation of the Workhouse
and the Infirmary. So large a proportion of the able-bodied
inmates of the workhouse are drunken, lazy,
and vicious, that, if the poor-law relief is not to
become a temptation and an injury to the honest
and struggling poor, the discipline must be almost
of a penal character. The paramount object must be
to make the workhouse, if not absolutely unpleasant,
less agreeable than the condition of laborious and
striving poverty. On the other hand, in a hospital
the paramount and almost the only object is
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
to promote recovery and to mitigate suffering; all
other considerations yield to this, and consequently
the treatment must necessarily be liberal in spirit and
indulgent in fact. The modes of treatment necessary
for the good management of the hospital patient and
of the able-bodied pauper, respectively, are distinct&mdash;almost
opposite: the infirmary and the workhouse
must be controlled on divergent, and even contrary
principles; and by bringing the two together under
one roof and one administration, they injure each
other. The indulgence of the infirmary creeps into
the workhouse, or the sternness of workhouse rules
cripples the benevolent energy which should rule the
infirmary. And the treatment of the able-bodied
pauper becomes too lax, or he is tempted to scheme,
and does scheme, to get himself transferred to the
more comfortable quarters close at hand; a desire so
prevalent as to give rise to malingering&mdash;the wilful
production of disease: while, partly no doubt in order
to counteract this tendency, there is in such mixed
establishments an unconscious disposition to treat the
hospital patient with the same stern economy that
is justly made the rule in dealing with able-bodied
pauperism, but which, in the infirmary, is not only
cruel, but in the long run is not truly economical.
Another most serious evil is entailed upon the hospital
by connexion with the workhouse. The habits and
traditions prevalent among the habitual paupers&mdash;able-bodied
paupers&mdash;in the workhouse (at least in
the workhouse of a large town), are too often deeply
infected with cunning, deception, and dishonesty of
all sorts, against which strict precaution and stern
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
repression are requisite; and it is most important
that no communication should be allowed, whereby
these habits of vice and stratagem might be introduced
into the hospital, where indulgence is the rule,
and where many things strictly denied to the inmates
of the workhouse, as stimulants for instance, are
necessarily permitted. The introduction of workhouse
tricks into a hospital, where they cannot be met by
workhouse control, must bring in an element of confusion,
disorder, and waste, and therefore the intercommunication
which might introduce those tricks
should be as effectually prevented as possible, which
it cannot be while the two institutions are, as at
present, combined. The two systems&mdash;to use an
English word in its French sense&mdash;demoralize each
other; and even in the English sense, their union
demoralizes the individuals subject to each.</p>
<p>When this is better understood and more clearly
apprehended, as it soon will be, through the experience
of several Unions in which the separation has been
already resolved on&mdash;it is probable that it will be
enforced by law. This may be expected to take place
in no very long time; and then it will be found that
any expenditure incurred in providing increased accommodation
on a plan which does not recognise the
necessity of separation has been, in part at least,
thrown away; and the work will have to be done,
and the money to be spent, over again.</p>

delegate to the paupers much of the hard but most instructive part of their
work. In ordinary workhouse hospitals, when there are no probationers,
a certain number of pauper assistants may perhaps be useful in aiding
thoroughly trained nurses.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
